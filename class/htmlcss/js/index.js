// Javascript we can declare variable - var, let and const are keyword.Keywords are reserved. so we can name it for variable like var var = "maddy";

// var is legacy keyword is not used mostlt trying to see the drawbacks with the code below
var myName = "Maddy";
let age = 10;
let active = true;
let membership;
